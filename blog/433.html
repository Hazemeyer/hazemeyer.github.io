                    <p>A flight deck cruiser proposal dating back to the early 1930s. Shortly after the Washington Naval Treaty,
                        the United States Navy wanted to develop a low cost platform for aircraft that could perform both scouting duties and artillery roles.
                        The idea of a flight deck cruiser was at first appealing, as it would be considered as a cruiser and would not count towards the limits set for aircraft 
                        carriers under the treaty. One of the proposed designs was described as half of a Brooklyn class forwards, and half of an aircraft carrier aft.
                        </p>
                        <p>Similar to the likes of Tier VIII Japanese cruiser Tone, we were inspired to refit a Brooklyn class cruiser into a hybrid based on the characteristics
                        of the flight deck cruiser designs the American navy came up with in the interwar period. Milwaukee has a total of 11 guns concentrated at the bow
                        using triple turrets from the Brooklyn class and quadruple turrets from preliminary American light cruiser designs.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>American cruiser Columbia, Tier X</strong></p>

                    <p><em>The ship is at a very early stage of modeling.</em></p>

                    <p>In the years leading up to the 1920s, a series of design studies on "maximum battleships" was prepared by the 
                       Bureau of Construction and Repair of the American Navy. These designs were largely influenced by Senator Tillman who was annoyed
                       with the navy's requrest to build larger ships every year and proposed to build the largest battleships possible, with the only limitation
                       being the dimensions of the locks of the Panama Canal. The final design that was presented to Congress was IV-2, which consisted of fifteen 18-inch guns
                       in five triple turrets, two fore and three aft. The ship would displace over 70,000 tons and would have a top speed of 25.2 knots.
                    </p>

                    <p>The American Navy could have launched a design study on "maximum cruisers" based on the IV-2 design in the hopes of constructing a more practical
                        capital ship with an emphasis on large quantities of 12-inch guns, similar to the ones mounted on the Alaska class cruisers. Columbia equips the same
                        amount of guns as the IV-2 design in a similar layout but is armed with 12-inch instead of 18-inch guns.

                <p>Some were destroyed in battle. Others weren't completed. Some were laid up and can only dream of
                    battles.</p>
                But now, they're getting a new lease of life. We make up ships accurately, according to our historical
                justification, and send them into battle.
