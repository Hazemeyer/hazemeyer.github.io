                    <p>A flight deck cruiser proposal dating back to the early 1930s. Shortly after the Washington Naval Treaty,
                        the United States Navy wanted to develop a low cost platform for aircraft that could perform both scouting duties and artillery roles.
                        The idea of a flight deck cruiser was at first appealing, as it would be considered as a cruiser and would bypass the limits set for aircraft 
                        carriers under the treaty.

                    <p>A design for a small B-type Battleship (Project 25) designed to counter heavy cruisers,
                        German pocket-battleships and the Scharnhorst-class battleships which were under construction at
                        the time.
                        The project was canceled in 1937 in favor of working on project 23, the Sovetsky Soyus class,
                        but the concept reappeared with the arrival of the Kronstadt-class large cruisers.
