                <div class="article__content">
                    <p>A second branch of
                        Soviet Battleships will be added to the game in one of the future
                        updates. We're ready to share the first details.&nbsp;</p>

                    <div class="article-cut" contenteditable="false">&nbsp;</div>

                    <p>In the current concept, these newcomers excel at mid-range,
                        thanks to an accurate main battery with mediocre range and
                        powerful secondary armament with improved range and increasingly
                        improved accuracy at higher tiers, with Tier X battleship Navarin
                        having a dispersion formula similar to that found on Tier X Italian cruiser Napoli.
                    </p>

                    <p>The ships in the branch are equipped with the Fighter consumable at Tiers V-VII,
                        which will be replaced on Tier VIII and onwards by Defensive AA Fire.
                        The main battery guns of the new battlecruisers have superb accuracy,
                        good penetration but lackluster range, which forces ships into a more active role.
                        Starting from Tier VIII, these ships have their entire main battery located at the front
                        and an increasing number of secondary guns. The secondary guns have increased penetration
                        and excellent firing angles, allowing some to even shoot over their own superstructure to attack
                        enemy vessels.
                    </p>

                    <p>Key characteristics of the ships will be high speed but poor maneuverability,
                        an armor scheme that allows great protection when angled well,
                        but will prove insufficient under heavy fire due to mediocre health.
                        This will put emphasis on good positioning, as these vessels will fail to quickly
                        reposition and become vulnerable while doing so. The ships boasts strong torpedo
                        protection and powerful long range anti aircraft armament, among the best of their class.
                    </p>

                    <p>Unlike the other branches of battlecruisers that have been introduced so far,
                        the Soviet battlecruisers will not have access to torpedoes.
                    </p>

                    <p>Lastly, these vessels will have access to the same Fast Damage Control Team
                        found on the existing Russian Battleships, but will have unlimited charges.
                        Additionally, the Soviet battlecruisers will receive a special “Heavy Repair Teams“
                        consumable similar to that found on Sevastopol, with long duration, but low damage recovery and
                        very long reload.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><strong>Soviet Battleship Frunze, Tier V</strong></p>

                    <p>A proposal dating back to 1933 for a radical modernization of the Gangut-class battleship
                        Poltava,
                        which had been heavily damaged by a fire in 1919 and had been renamed to Frunze.
                        The modernization would have been similar to that of the Italian battleships of the Conte di
                        Cavour and Caio Duilio-class.
                        The project was canceled in 1935 due to a lack of capacity in the young Soviet shipbuilding
                        industry.

                    <p>A design for a small B-type Battleship (Project 25) designed to counter heavy cruisers,
                        German pocket-battleships and the Scharnhorst-class battleships which were under construction at
                        the time.
                        The project was canceled in 1937 in favor of working on project 23, the Sovetsky Soyus class,
                        but the concept reappeared with the arrival of the Kronstadt-class large cruisers.
                    </p>

                    <p>The vessel is named after the battle of Chesma, one of the largest naval victories of the Russian
                        navy.
                        It greatly reduced the power of the Ottoman navy and secured Russian dominance in the Black sea
                        and even the Aegean sea.

                    <p>A design for a potential completion of the Izmail-class battlecruiser Kinburn in a similar
                        fashion as had been proposed for Frunze.
                        The ship is presented with a potential post-WWII retrofit. Historically, no plan like this was
                        ever brought forward,
                        but until the early 1930s, various ideas of completing one of the Izmail-class battlecruisers
                        were tossed around,
                        and its reasonable to assume that with a more advanced shipbuilding industry, the Soviet navy
                        could have tried to complete
                        such a large vessel in the late 1920s and early 30s.</p>

                    <p>Based on a design for a “small battleship“ that was developed in the post-war period.
                        The ship is presented with an enhanced secondary battery. Kazan is named after the Battle of
                        Kazan (1774)
                        which was part of the Pugachev rebellion against the Russian Tzars. The Battle of Kazan saw
                        widespread use within Soviet propaganda,
                        making it a possible name for a new Soviet Battleship.

                        cold-war era super-battleships of the NATO-fleet. Navarin features 406mm guns based in quadruple
                        turrets,
                        a design that was first developed during World War 1 and could have been picked up again by
                        Soviet designers in a

                    <p>The ship is named after the Battle of Navarin of 1827, during which a combined Russian, British
                        and French fleet
                        utterly defeated an Ottoman-Egyptian fleet. To this day, it’s considered among the most

                    <p>A large battleship armed with quadruple 457 mm guns and powerful anti-aircraft artillery.
                        The design of the ship is based upon studies that, much later, would culminate in what is often
                        considered the last real battlecruisers
                        – the Kirov-class guided missile cruiser.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The ship is named after one of the most important battles of World War 2, the Battle of Kursk.
                        It was a crushing defeat for the
                        German Wehrmacht, especially their tank divisions, and effectively ended all German advances
                        into the Soviet Union.

                    <p><strong>Soviet Battleship Grengam, Tier X</strong></p>

                    <p><img src="432/xp.png"

                    <p>An enlarged version of the “small battleship” concept armed with modern 457mm guns that were
                        developed in the Soviet Union after World War 2.
                    </p>

                    <p>Unlike her tech-tree Counterparts, Grengam is a fast but vulnerable battleship
                        that excels at mid-to long ranges with a very small healthpool and weak armor.
                        This is offset by her hyper-efficient main battery with long range, precise accuracy,
                        medium reload and fast turning speed, which is further enhanced by Grengams ability to turn her
                        main battery 360 degrees.
                    </p>

                    <p>Additionally, Grengam will have access to both Hydroacoustic Search and Short Duration
                        Surveilance Radar,
                        similar to that of Petropavlovsk, but with shorter reload and more charges.
                        This allows the ship to provide frequent intelligence to its teammates for offensive and
                        defensive actions.
                    </p>

                    <p>Grengam also features long-range secondaries with improved dispersion, but in much fewer numbers
                        and without improved penetration,
                        limiting them to an effective, yet only defensive tool. To offset these powerful tools,
                        Grengam will feature only a standard damage control party and will be the first battleship in
                        the game
                        without access to the repair party consumable.
                    </p>

                    <p>The ship is named after the Battle of Grengam of 1720, a central part of the great Northern war
                        between Russia and Sweden,
                        of which Russia would come out victorious.
