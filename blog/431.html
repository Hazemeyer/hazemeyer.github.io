        <h2 class="article__title">Balance Changes – Public Test 12.3</h2>
                <div class="article__content"><p>We're applying balance changes to Tier X destroyer Ragnar, 
                    based on the analysis of player feedback. In this devblog, we will address the most common concerns 
                    with the appropriate balance changes and a detailed explanation.</p>

<div class="article-cut" contenteditable="false">&nbsp;</div>

<p><div><strong><span class="ship" data-level="10" data-nation="europe" data-rare="true" data-special="true" data-type="destroyer" contenteditable="false">Ragnar</span></strong></p>


<p><strong>“No burst damage to speak of.”</strong></p>
<p>Parameter change:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Added “Burst Fire”  alternate fire mode with the following parameters: (Reload time - 300.0 s Burst interval - 0.05 s. Shot in the series 100.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Previously, Ragnar had relatively poor burst damage. 
   Now with the alternate fire mode, players will have the option to fire 100 salvos in as little as 5 seconds with a cooldown of 5 minutes.
</p>

<p><strong>“I don’t like the split turrets.”</strong></p>
<p>Parameter change:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Replaced aft turret with decorative lifeboats.</li>
	<li>Increased gun count in the foremost turret from 2 to 4 guns.</li>
</ul>
<p>We take player feedback very seriously and we decided to change the gun layout of Ragnar to an all forward layout.
    Since there's only one forward turret, they will no longer be "split".
    Captains that are familiar with Druid will feel much more comfortable with the changes.</p>

<p><strong>“The ship retains a relatively fragile platform.”</strong></p>
<p>Parameter change:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Increased hull plating from 25 to 50 mm.</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to the low survivability of the ship, we decided to increase the hull plating to 50 mm, 
    which will allow players, when angled properly, to bounce AP shells of all calibers within the matchmaking range.
</p>

<p><strong>“It lacks the necessary attributes to make meaningful impact on match result.”</strong></p>
<p>Parameter change:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Action time of the Surveillance Radar consumable reduced: 30 to 1 s.</li>
    <li>Surveillance Radar consumable ship detection range increased: 7.5 to 20 km.</li>
    <li>Number of Surveillance Radar consumable charges increased from 2 to 100.</li>
    <li>Cooldown time of Surveillance Radar reduced from 120 to 5 s.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to increase Ragnar’s ability to impact matches, we tweaked the Surveillance Radar consumable to encourage players to use it more often. 
    This allows Ragnar to play a lead role in providing intelligence data to teammates with a greater active use of Surveillance Radar.</p>

    <p>We believe the following changes will address the issues with Ragnar’s performance and will make the ship 
    “inherently balanced” for an enjoyable experience for all captains in battle.</p>

<p><strong>Please note that all information in the development blog is preliminary. Announced adjustments and features may change multiple times during testing. The final information will be published on our game&#39;s website.</strong></p>

            <p>Some were destroyed in battle. Others weren't completed. Some were laid up and can only dream of
                battles.</p>
            But now, they're getting a new lease of life. We make up ships accurately, according to our historical
            justification, and send them into battle.
